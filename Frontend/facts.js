The CAD plays a crucial role in North American trade and reflects Canada’s economic stability and resource-based economy.",

"history": "Canada transitioned from using the British Pound Sterling to adopting the dollar system in the mid-19th century to align more closely with the United States and simplify trade. The modern Canadian Dollar was officially established in 1871 under the Uniform Currency Act, uniting the country's various provincial currencies under a single system.

"economic": "The Canadian Dollar's value is closely tied to global commodity prices, particularly crude oil and natural resources, as Canada is a major exporter of energy products. This has led to the CAD being considered a commodity currency, with fluctuations in global demand for these resources impacting its value. Additionally, the Canadian economy has a close relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner, which significantly influences the CAD's performance in the foreign exchange market.",

"design": "Canada's latest series of banknotes is made from durable polymer materials, incorporating advanced security features such as transparent windows, holographic elements, and tactile features for the visually impaired. The current banknotes feature an innovative vertical design and showcase significant Canadian figures and achievements, such as civil rights activist Viola Desmond, while celebrating the nation's cultural heritage and commitment to inclusivity and innovation.",
